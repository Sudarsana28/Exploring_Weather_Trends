## Exploring Weather Trends 

In this project, I have analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends to where I live (Atlanta) to overall global temperature trends.

### Steps to create the Visualization

• Extracting Data from the Database using the Udacity Workspace. Writing SQL queries to extract temperature data for both Global and City Level and exporting them to CSVs.  
• Opening up the CSV files in Excel and plotting the calculated moving averages in a Line chart that compares our City temperature with the Global temperature.   
• Making observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and the city’s averages as well as on the overall trends.
